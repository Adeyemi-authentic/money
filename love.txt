i have a lot to let out,
i miss you so much 
you are the diamond in the rough
i love you so much 
i care so much about you 
but ihave to put me first 
you are my love , my one and only 
she's the one for me 
my one and only 
things will get better 



nothing lasts forever 
will you be my nothing 

you are the one for me and not for him
my woman  my everything
i wanna be your everything , your confidant
your lover 
your soulmate 
your colgate


this is rare piece from my heart
as you are the rara piece that my heart needs 
its over between me and her 
no iota of love for her 
all for you none for them
all for you baby
